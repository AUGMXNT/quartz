## Mood: Bearish, Waiting for Capitulation

If you're long-term bullish and not leveraged, just sit tight, nothing to do except potentially buy a capitulation. Since Nov have been consolidating to high conviction plays, but now is the time to protect downside, potentially to hedge if overexposed. Despite relief rallies, I'm waiting for capitulation (or breaking the bear market resistance and holding support) before "buying the dip"/declaring game on:
* OI back down significantly, maybe 1 more shakeout? https://coinalyze.net/bitcoin/open-interest/ ; Long/Short ratio: https://coinalyze.net/bitcoin/open-interest/

### Factors:
* Bad macro (FOMC, rates)
* Geo-risk (WW3)
* Retail bad (Collapse of rebase tokens, Dani/Quadriga scandal, MIM/UST depeg risk)

Reading the market: https://cryptohayes.medium.com/
* Arthur correctly called this correction so [his latest article](https://cryptohayes.medium.com/bottomless-29160a0156cd) is absolutely worth paying attention to. He's looking to see if there's a bounce at 28.5K BTC, 1.7K ETH - if it doesn't, look for a retest of last ATHs (20K BTC, 1.4K ETH)

### US Regulatory threats
* [Urgent Considerations of Impact on Blockchain/DeFi of the SEC's Proposed Regulation ATS Amendment](https://lexnode.substack.com/p/urgent-considerations-of-impact-on?justPublished=true)
* [# New bill would hand Treasury blank check to ban crypto at exchanges](https://www.coincenter.org/new-bill-would-hand-treasury-blank-check-to-ban-crypto-at-exchanges/)
* [White House Wants Crypto Rules as a Matter of National Security](https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454)

## Plays
My core holding remains ETH (70%+); I have about 5-10% hedged out in pure stables

### Theses
  * Strong L1/L2s: ATOM eco, AVAX, MATIC, METIS, NEAR/AURORA
  * Options Protocols: DPX, GNS, GMX
  * Money printers: FXS, CVX, CRV, TOKE, LOOKS

### Abandoned
* Dani Coins: mostly exited SPELL (it should survive, but took a small L to limit exposure). ICE should still survive as well but I'm more bearish but such a small position that's so far underwater it doesn't matte

### Ethereum
Don't play here w/ $10Ks or fees will kill you. FXS and Uniswap fees can be $200+/tx 
* Lots of veFXS generating maximum yields on [gauge stable pools](https://app.frax.finance/staking#)
* Rest of FXS in [Tokemak](https://www.tokemak.xyz/) until FPI announcement, then will [lock as cvxFXS](https://frax.convexfinance.com/)
* A chunk of CRV exposure as very tax efficient play w/ yvBOOST since it was [trading way below backing price](https://blockenthusiast.substack.com/p/yvboost-a-sleeping-giant) - apparently [I wasn't the only one to spot this](https://twitter.com/vannny365/status/1487194028470845441)...
* Additonal income generation with cvxCRV - it's cheaper to buy on the open market and [stake](https://www.convexfinance.com/stake) than to convert CRV. Generates about 55% APR including 15% atm of 3crv (stablecoin); <$3 seems like a decent price atm to me
* CVX into [vlCVX](https://www.convexfinance.com/lock-cvx) and delegating vote to [Votium](https://votium.app/) is you want a [decent return](https://llama.airforce/#/votium/rounds) in tokens you want to collect (FRAX or more CVX for me); <$25 seems like a decent price to me atm
* I'm in a bunch of UniV3 positions that I'm using to generate yield positioned for cheap entries. Not recommended unless you know what you're doing

### Arbitrum
* I've done well with farming [DPX/rDPX](https://app.dopex.io/farms) and have been making great monthly returns with deposits in the [ETH SSOV](https://app.dopex.io/ssov/manage/ETH)
