## Mood: Bearish, Waiting for Capitulation

If you're long-term bullish and not leveraged, just sit tight, nothing to do except potentially buy a capitulation. Since Nov have been consolidating to high conviction plays, but now is the time to protect downside, potentially to hedge if overexposed. Despite relief rallies, I'm waiting for capitulation (or breaking the bear market resistance and holding support) before "buying the dip"/declaring game on:
* OI back down significantly, maybe 1 more shakeout? https://coinalyze.net/bitcoin/open-interest/ ; Long/Short ratio: https://coinalyze.net/bitcoin/open-interest/

### Factors:
* Bad macro (FOMC, rates)
* Geo-risk (WW3)
* Retail bad (Collapse of rebase tokens, Dani/Quadriga scandal, MIM/UST depeg risk)

Reading the market: https://cryptohayes.medium.com/
* Arthur correctly called this correction so [his latest article](https://cryptohayes.medium.com/bottomless-29160a0156cd) is absolutely worth paying attention to. He's looking to see if there's a bounce at 28.5K BTC, 1.7K ETH - if it doesn't, look for a retest of last ATHs (20K BTC, 1.4K ETH)

### US Regulatory threats
* [Urgent Considerations of Impact on Blockchain/DeFi of the SEC's Proposed Regulation ATS Amendment](https://lexnode.substack.com/p/urgent-considerations-of-impact-on?justPublished=true)
* [# New bill would hand Treasury blank check to ban crypto at exchanges](https://www.coincenter.org/new-bill-would-hand-treasury-blank-check-to-ban-crypto-at-exchanges/)
* [White House Wants Crypto Rules as a Matter of National Security](https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454)

## Plays
My core holding remains ETH (70%+); I have about 5-10% hedged out in pure stables

Theses
  * Strong L1/L2s: ATOM eco, AVAX, MATIC, METIS, NEAR/AURORA
  * Options Protocols: DPX, GNS, GMX
  * Money printers: FXS, CVX, CRV, TOKE, LOOKS

Abandoned
* Dani Coins: mostly exited SPELL (it should survive, but took a small L to limit exposure). ICE should still survive as well but I'm more bearish but such a small position that's so far underwater it doesn't matte

Ethereum
* Lots of veFXS generating maximum yields on [gauge stable pools](https://app.frax.finance/staking#)
* Rest of FXS in [Tokemak](https://www.tokemak.xyz/) until FPI announcement, then will [lock as cvxFXS](https://frax.convexfinance.com/)
* A chunk of CRV as yvBOOST
