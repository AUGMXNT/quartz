Mood: Bearish, Waiting for Capitulation

If you're long-term bullish and not leveraged, just sit tight, nothing to do except potentially buy a capitulation.

* OI back down significantly, maybe 1 more shakeout? https://coinalyze.net/bitcoin/open-interest/ ; Long/Short ratio: https://coinalyze.net/bitcoin/open-interest/


Factors:
* Bad macro (FOMC, rates)
* Geo-risk (WW3)
* Retail bad (Collapse of rebase tokens, Dani/Quadriga scandal, MIM/UST depeg risk)
