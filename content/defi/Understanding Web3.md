# What is Web3 (web3)
The Web 3.0->Web3 we are talking about was originally coined by Gavin York (co-founder of Ethereum, now Parity/Polkadot) back in 2014, not to be confused with the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) - Web 3.0 coined by TBL (2006) but that never gained traction.

web3 started getting real traction in 2021 as a rebranding of "crypto" as DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs have started taking off.

While the stated goals/mission for Web 3.0 includes decentralization and user control of their data and identity, and monetization and sustainability models are drastically different, when boiled down to a base level (IMO), what web3 adds is a credibly neutral system for transferring value on the Internet (in the way that Web 1.0 was primarily about self-publishing information, and Web 2.0 about social aggregation and communication).

* Decentralized authentication using private key signatures (wallets)
* Platforms and protocols implement native value transfer mechanisms on credibly neutral, permissionless networks
* Multiple clients and frontend interfaces are available
* User participation (ownership, governance) in protocol/platform value accrual via tokenization

The current state of web3 is technologically nascent, but this is a paradigmatic shift from the mature Web 2.0 (2008-present)
