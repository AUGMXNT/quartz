# What is Web3 (web3)
The Web 3.0->Web3 we are talking about was originally coined by Gavin York (co-founder of Ethereum, now Parity/Polkadot) back in 2014, not to be confused with the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) - Web 3.0 coined by TBL (2006) but that never gained traction.

web3 started getting real traction in 2021 as a rebranding of "crypto" as DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs have started taking off.

While the stated goals/mission for Web 3.0 includes decentralization and user control of their data and identity, the (IMO) on a more practical level, what web3 adds is a credibly neutral system for transferring value on the Internet.
