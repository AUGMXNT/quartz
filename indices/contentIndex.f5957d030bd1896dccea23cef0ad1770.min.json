Generates about 55% APR including 15% atm of 3crv (stablecoin); \u003c$3 seems like a decent price atm to me\n* CVX into [vlCVX](https://www.convexfinance.com/lock-cvx) and delegating vote to [Votium](https://votium.app/) is you want a [decent return](https://llama.airforce/#/votium/rounds) in tokens you want to collect (FRAX or more CVX for me); \u003c$25 seems like a decent price to me atm\n* I'm in a bunch of UniV3 positions that I'm using to generate yield positioned for cheap entries.

I'm using [Aave on Instadapp Polygon](https://gmx.io/earn) for doing shorting with debt swaps between ETH and USDC/DAI. I'm doing this primarily as a downside hedge rather than scalping. If ETH goes below 1700 I will probably freeze all my outstanding stablecoin loans as crypto (ETH or more volatile if possible) until we turn the corner\n* Mai Finance is offering 60% in weekly QI rewards (on a tear) camMATIC [in vaults atm](https://app.mai.finance/vaults/create) - these are single-staking and require keeping collateral ratios in a band (160%-405%) - it's a very similar model to Abracadabra, but currently the best place to store MATIC to farm stables. [MAI-USDC on Beefy](https://app.beefy.finance/#/polygon/vault/mai-usdc-mimatic) is probably the easiest\n* UniV3 MATIC/ETH and Quickswap MATIC/PECO offer nice LP returns with limited IL, might be worthwhile (I'm not in these)\n\n### Avalanche\n* [GLP on GMX](https://gmx.io/earn) is like atricrypto but with returns on steroids.
